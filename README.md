# IEEE-Satellite-Imagery-Change-Detection

Detecting changes in satellite imagery is essential for applications such as 
environmental monitoring, urban expansion analysis, and disaster response. This 
report explores multiple approaches for automated change detection, evaluating 
their effectiveness in identifying meaningful differences across satellite images. The 
methods tested include RAVEN (Recurrent Attention-based Visual Extraction 
Network), SAM-CVM (Segment Anything Model with Change Vector Magnitude), 
and spectral indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and 
NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index). Additionally, an SVC (Support Vector 
Classifier) was employed to enhance classification accuracy. Each approach was 
analyzed for its strengths and limitations in detecting and classifying changes. The 
f
 indings provide insights into the applicability of these techniques for various 
change detection scenarios, offering a comparative assessment of their 
performance.
